		"bio": "<p> Andrew approaches software development like a zen art - he believes that true progress is made by focusing on small, steady improvements over flashy breakthroughs.</p><p>With a background in music, Andrew brings a spirit of discipline and rigorous practice to his development work. He believes that daily progress — even just 5 minutes each day coding or reading documentation — is the first step to mastery. Ultimate mastery comes from rethinking and refining one's practice routine again and again.</p><p>Andrew's \"just in time\" solutions and love for \"tracer bullet\" prototyping keep projects moving forward. Andrew is always pushing for the next most important thing - helping his team reach the finish line ahead of the competition. When problems do arise, (99% of the time, due to problematic data structures or concurrency), Andrew loves a good challenge and is always ready to roll up his sleeves and dive in.</p><p>Andrew's toolkit includes several programming languages (Python, PHP, JavaScript), relational databases (especially MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server), and a suite of DevOps tools (Git, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins).<p>When Andrew is not deep in code, he is probably busy dreaming of programming in a forest or traveling back in time to design a best-selling real-time strategy game with Julius Caesar </p>"

		"bio": "<p>Missie is a web developer who flows seamlessly between frontend poses and backend stretches, skillfully working towards that full-stack “Scorpion Pose.” Her practice involves a steady love for TypeScript — stronger than JavaScript’s “Downward Dog” and just as flexible. React and Vue are her trusty yoga blocks, helping her find balance in the ever changing world of code.</p><p>Challenges are her yoga props; they stretch her capabilities, strengthen her resolve, and occasionally make her wobble. But, like any true yogi, she believes that each bug and setback is just another opportunity for growth — or at least a reason to roll out the mat and try again.</p><p>What inspires her? The balance between the practical and the creative. Web development is like finding your breath in a tricky balance pose — grounded yet expressive. Her mantra is simple: “The project is never finished, only refined.”</p><p>Every project, like every yoga session, offers a new lesson, a chance to go deeper, and a reminder that nothing is ever truly finished. This mindset energizes her when inspiration flows, comforts her during moments of burnout, keeps her humble when she’s feeling like a coding guru, and props her up when she's face-planted on the mat.</p>"

If Logan were a programming language, he'd be Python: efficient, flexible, and always ready to automate the tedious into oblivion with a swift, well-placed strike.</p><p>His coding dojo is a cozy office nestled in a cabin deep in the wilderness, where the sun illuminates his workspace like a morning meditation. Logan observes his surroundings with the quiet intensity of an owl — still, focused, and ready to pounce on inefficiency wherever it hides. Each day, he practices his own secret discipline: taking meticulous notes on anything unfamiliar and connecting the dots in a grand mental map of knowledge.</p><p>Logan’s style is pure kung fu coding — like a classical music composer who refuses to let a single note out of place, he moves slowly and deliberately, perfecting each function with the precision of a samurai sharpening his blade. And if he could pair program with anyone, he'd probably summon an ancient engineer and a dusty vacuum tube computer, seeking enlightenment in the art of analog technology. Because why settle for the latest gadgets when you can learn from the roots, even if those roots are as bulky and inefficient as a 1950s mainframe?</p><p>Logan isn’t just about the fight; he's about the discipline, the journey, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing that when he strikes, he strikes true.</p>"
